# Garage Feature

The garage feature allows users to manage their parking spaces. The screens for this feature are located in the `Garage/` directory.

## Screens

*   **`VagasTableViewController`**: Displays a list of the user's available parking spaces.
*   **`NovaVagaViewController`**: A form to add a new parking space.
*   **`VisualizarVagaViewController`**: Displays the details of a specific parking space.
*   **`AtualizarFrequenciaViewController`**: Allows the user to update the availability of a parking space.

## Logic

The garage feature uses Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve information about the parking spaces. The view controllers handle the logic for adding, viewing, and updating the parking spaces.
