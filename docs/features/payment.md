# Payment Feature

The payment feature allows users to pay for their parking spaces. The screens for this feature are located in the `Pagamento/` directory.

## Screens

*   **`PagamentoViewController`**: The main payment screen where users can enter their payment information.
*   **`PagamentoTableViewController`**: Displays a list of the user's payment methods.

## Logic

The payment feature is not fully implemented in the current version of the application. The screens are placeholders for a future implementation of a payment gateway.
